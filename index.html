<b id="why">Why Should I Donate?</b>
<p>Some of us are privileged, some of us are not.<br>Your small donation will make huge difference in the life of underprivileged<br>childrens and their education. Let's become a helping hand, and make<br>everyone educated. All the donations will be used to buy books, pay<br>the school fees, and other requirements for kids. </p>

<div class="about">
<b id="about">About Us</b>
<p>This is a sample project by Prem Joshi and The Sparks Foundation.<br>Note that the above donation is in a Test Mode, that means you<br>are not donating your real money! But I surely support the ideology<br>that everyone must be educated, and we must help the needy.<br>Thank You for visiting this site!</p>
